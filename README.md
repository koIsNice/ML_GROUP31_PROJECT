For the final project, we join a competition in Kaggle [(Link)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/um-game-playing-strength-of-mcts-variants) and we ranked 282/1610.

In this project, we use the model Catboost with the preprocessed dataset.
The dataset can be obtained by unzip the dataset.zip. We can get the preprocessed dataset by execute the preprocess.py with the unzipped dataset.

Once we obtain the preprocessed data, we can execute the blocks in main.ipynb block by block to train the model.

We also upload a zipped catboost model in the directory 'models'. We can use it by unzip the cat_adv.zip .
